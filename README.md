# Firmware-Style Device Controller: Test Suite

This project simulates testing a basic firmware-level `DeviceController` class, with realistic boot behavior, state management, and command sending, all using Python and `pytest`.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
src/
â””â”€â”€ device.py # Contains the DeviceController and custom exceptions

tests/
â””â”€â”€ test_device.py # Tests the controller behavior using fake hardware

## ðŸ§  What the Code Does

The `DeviceController` class simulates a firmware device that:
- Powers on hardware and checks readiness.
- Raises errors if booting fails or commands are sent while not ready.
- Sends commands only after a successful boot.
- Powers off and resets state on shutdown.

The hardware interface is simulated using a `FakeHardware` class with:
- Configurable boot delays.
- Command storage.
- Status simulation ("BOOTING" vs "READY").

## âœ… What is Being Tested

Tests in `test_device.py` cover:

- âœ… Device boots successfully on first try.
- âœ… Device needs multiple attempts to boot.
- âœ… Device fails to boot (raises timeout error).
- âœ… Sending a command before boot fails (raises not-ready error).
- âœ… Sending a command after boot succeeds and returns ACK.
- âœ… Shutdown resets device readiness state.

All tests use dependency injection to simulate real hardware behavior using test fixtures.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run the Tests

Make sure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Then run:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```
